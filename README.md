# Let's make a puzzle game
The idea here is to come up with a project that users can contribute to while testing GIT skills.
Each user can create their own puzzle that needs to be solved by the visitor. 
Once each puzzle is solved game is over

#What is required
* We require a UI semantic/bootstrap
* Jquery
* a way to manage different levels
* stop users from using developer.console to cheat
